# Sentencing by Numbers

First and foremost, Welcome! Willkommen! Bienvenue! 

## Introduction

Thank you for visiting the Sentencing By Numbers project repository. This document (the README file) is a hub to give you some information about the Sentencing by Numbers project.

Governments are using technology to decide who to incarcerate, provide medical care, or give access to affordable housing. These decision-making tools are made from algorithms to measure "risk" in the United States and assign "social scores" to individuals in China. These tools are often used without public consent and udnermine civil liberties and data privacy. These tools should be transparent and accountable to the public. 

Please join us during the Global Sprint to dismantle these black boxes and help the public reveal what is behind the curtain of these machines. 

## Getting Started

Background

Algorithms are used by law enforcement in America for surveillance and censorship. These algorithms contribute to targeting and shutting down political opposition at rally events, civil liberty advocacy, or the general public. The public should have the right to evaluate and audit these black boxes. Algorithms often rely on data that are embedded with selection and confirmation biases, leading to erroneous results, outcomes, or predictions. We want to transform this data into human stories. This project aims to: 1) increase data literacy (how data is collected, where to find open data sources, understand the gaps within this data) and 2) develop tools for documenting and organizing against practices that may undermine civil liberties, human rights, and Internet privacy.

Example Projects

1) Algorithm Zine -- "Algorithm Killed the Radio Star"

2) Algorithm Game
Scenarios are given and the participant decides if they agree or disagree with the case study. Example: An algorithm is used to determined whether to remove a child from their home. 

3) A webtool of over 100 algorithmic tools used in USA. Global Sprint participants could help contribute to asking questions about data or with visualization

4) There is an open sourced algorithm used for predictive policing. Participants could examine it and use REAL data sets to analyze the source code

## Contributing

The Sentencing by Numbers project would like your input on how we could increase the transparency of algorithms designed and used by governments in the public sector. Are you a computer scientist with a background on AI? Or are you may be a talented visual artist. Or someone who is good at reminding your team lunch is ready? We welcome your ideas and unique talent, and will not discount anyone's contribution.

## Participation Guidelines

This project adheres to a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [EMAIL].
