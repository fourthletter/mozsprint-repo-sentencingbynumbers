# Sentencing by Numbers

Algorithms are increasingly being used to undermine human rights around the world. My proposed project will help communities fight against algorithmic tyranny. Communities should have a right to dismantle these “black boxes” and evaluate whether these tools are perpetuating racial, ethnic, and economic biases. Citizens should have the right to know how governments design and implement algorithms in law enforcement and in other facets of life.(https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/introduction-to-open-leadership/stating-your-project-vision/)? 

First and foremost, Welcome! 🎉 Willkommen! 🎊 Bienvenue! 🎈🎈🎈

Thank you for visiting the Sentencing By Numbers project repository. This document (the README file) is a hub to give you some information about the project.

## Getting Started

The problem

Algorithms are increasingly being used by law enforcement in the United States for surveillance and censorship. These algorithms contribute to targeting and shutting down political opposition at rally events, civil liberty advocacy, or the general public. Algorithms have been the underpinning of technology like assigning risk scores to travelers at border crossings in the U.S. and evaluate good citizenship in China.

We have the right to evaluate and audit these “black boxes” for biases. Algorithms act on human biases by replicating these biases, thereby reinforcing and even exacerbating existing inequalities. Data literacy is a path to better understanding the human decisions behind the curtain of the great and powerful AI.

The solution

Algorithms often rely on data that are embedded with selection and confirmation biases, leading to erroneous results, outcomes, or predictions. We want to transform this data into human stories. This project aims to:

    increase data literacy (how data is collected, where to find open data sources, understand the gaps within this data)
    develop tools for documenting and organizing against practices that may undermine civil liberties, human rights, and Internet privacy.
